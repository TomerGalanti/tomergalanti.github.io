  <summary>Applying as a Ph.D. student?</summary>
  <br /><br />
  Apply through the Texas A&M graduate admission system. In your statement of purpose, mention our lab and, if applicable, a specific project you would like to work on. You can increase your chances of admission by reading one of the lab's papers and suggesting your own ideas on how to extend the underlying research (be creative). A strong applicant provides evidence of the following three traits:
  <br><br>
  1. <strong>Creative and self-sufficient.</strong> I will provide guidance and mentoring as needed but I expect students to develop their own ideas, analyze results, identify patterns and issues, and explore known and new approaches to overcome emerging issues.
  <br><br>
  2. <strong>Good coding capabilities.</strong> Students are expected to be skilled programmers, write structured and scalable code in a modular approach and produce code that is both efficient and easy to follow and manipulate.
  <br><br>
  3. <strong>A theory mindset.</strong> A passion for understanding how things work from a theoretical standpoint. This is a "soft theory" group so you should be able to at least think about the big picture.
  <br><br>
  4. <strong>Proficiency in English (speaking and writing).</strong> Students are expected to write papers and discuss their research.
  <br><br>
  Once you submit your application, the PhD admission committee will review your credentials (GRA, TOEFL, GPA, LOP, references) and decide on your admissibility. If your case is deemed admissible, I will set an interview with you during which we will discuss your fields of interest and experience, and whether you'll be a good fit to our lab. Once this process is finalized, I will extend an offer to those that best fit the lab's needs. I cannot give any guarantees in advance other than that I will examine all applications and seriously consider them.
  <br><br>
  Current master and bachelor level lab members are welcome to apply for a PhD position. In such cases, you are expected to be involved in preliminary research and demonstrate self-sufficiency. Please contact the lab director directly if you would like to explore this option.
  <br><br>
  * Donâ€™t worry about sharing your ideas. Assuming they are not trivial or previously published, I will not use, develop, or present your ideas without your consent.
  <br><br>
  Position description: As a PhD student, you are expected to lead research projects. Leading a project requires you to develop and manage the affiliated codebase, guide interns and undergrads, perform sound research, and, ultimately, publish research papers. We will have weekly meetings where you will report progress during the past week, issues that you encountered, possible ways to address these issues, and objectives that you hope to accomplish in the following week. PhD students are expected to apply for fellowships that are relevant to them.

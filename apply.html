  <summary><strong>Applying as a PhD student?</strong></summary>
  <br />
  Apply through the Texas A&M graduate admission system. In your statement of purpose, mention our lab and, if applicable, a specific project you would like to work on. You can increase your chances of admission by reading one of the lab's papers and suggesting your own ideas on how to extend the underlying research (be creative). A strong applicant provides evidence of the following three traits:
  <br><br>
  1. <strong>Creative and self-reliant.</strong> While I will offer guidance and mentoring when necessary, I expect students to take the initiative in developing their own ideas, conducting experiments and suggesting projects.
  <br><br>
  2. <strong>Coding proficiency.</strong> Students are expected to be skilled programmers, capable of writing structured and scalable code using a modular approach, and producing code that is both efficient and easy to follow.
  <br><br>
  3. <strong>A theoretical mindset.</strong> A deep passion for understanding how things work from a theoretical perspective. This is a "soft theory" group, so it's essential to be able to consider and conceptualize the bigger picture.
  <br><br>
  4. <strong>Proficiency in English (speaking and writing).</strong> Students are expected to effectively write academic papers and engage in discussions about their research.
  <br><br>
  Once you submit your application, the PhD admission committee will review your credentials (GRA, TOEFL, GPA, LOP, references) and decide on your admissibility. If your case is deemed admissible, I will set an interview with you during which we will discuss your fields of interest and experience, and whether you'll be a good fit to our lab. Once this process is finalized, I will extend an offer to those that best fit the lab's needs. I cannot give any guarantees in advance other than that I will examine all applications and seriously consider them.
  <br><br>
  Current master and bachelor level lab members are welcome to apply for a PhD position. In such cases, you are expected to be involved in preliminary research and demonstrate self-sufficiency. Please contact the lab director directly if you would like to explore this option.
  <br><br>
  * Donâ€™t worry about sharing your ideas. Assuming they are not trivial or previously published, I will not use, develop, or present your ideas without your consent.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Position description:</strong> As a PhD student, you are expected to lead research projects. Leading a project requires you to develop and manage the affiliated codebase, guide interns and undergrads, perform sound research, and, ultimately, publish research papers. We will have weekly meetings where you will report progress during the past week, issues that you encountered, possible ways to address these issues, and objectives that you hope to accomplish in the following week. PhD students are expected to apply for fellowships that are relevant to them.

<summary><strong>Applying as an MSc student?</strong></summary>
<br />
MSc applications follow a process and requirements similar to those of a PhD application (see above). Currently enrolled MSc students are welcome to join our lab meetings and participate in research projects. During the meetings, we will discuss various research projects that our lab is currently involved in. If you find a project of interest, please contact the leading student to discuss opportunities for you to contribute. Given sufficient contribution, I will happily support a transfer application from a non-thesis track to a thesis track. Exceptional MSc students will be offered admission to the PhD track.
<br><br>
<strong>Position description:</strong> As an MSc student, you are expected to support a research project (usually led by a PhD student). You will be responsible for a well-defined sub-project. You are not required to come up with your own ideas, but you are encouraged to do so. <br>

<summary><strong>Volunteering and research credit?</strong></summary>
<br />
No need to apply. Simply join our lab meetings and participate in a research project. During the meeting, we will discuss various research projects that our lab is currently involved with. If you find a project that is of interest to you, please contact the leading student and discuss opportunities for you to contribute. If you are interested in research credit (CSCE-491), please join the lab as a volunteer prior to submitting a 491 request. CSCE-491 enrollment will be considered based on your preliminary progress.
